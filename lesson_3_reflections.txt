When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to collaborate with others on the project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might want to keep your local copy of something.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

You can make a branch in your working directory, fork on GitHub from one repo to another repo, and clone a repo from GitHub down to your working directory.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

So you can pull new stuff on the remote and not create conflicts locally.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

The other people and I would change files locally and copy and paste in each other's changes. This is harder than letting GitHub merge changes for us.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

If you need to create a new feature that needs approval/collaboration from others before an agreement is made to include in master.
